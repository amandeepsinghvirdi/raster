// #The index file
// Raster is a normal web framework so all requests have a single
// entry point, which is the index.php file. It can be renamed and it serves
// as the entry point for one application.

// ### Bootstrap
// The first thing we load is the boot class
// which handles auto magic and also wires up the framework
require_once 'system/boot.php';

// ### App name
// We give the application a name.
// By updating the name you can have more than one application
// using the same codebase, for example, add a blog.php file, update it like:
//
// ```
// boot::$appname = 'blog';
// ```
//
// and then in .htaccess direct all requests to blog.php. 
boot::$appname = 'application';

// ### We're away!
// The static boot::up() method is all it takes to have
// Raster load and execute all the proper files for the
// current request
boot::up();

// Next source to read: ```/system/boot.php```
